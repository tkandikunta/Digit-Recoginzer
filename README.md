# Digit-Recongnizer
 Summary:-Digit-Recongnizer 
 Here we used to find digits accuracy by predicting from train to test to get the more accuracy to it.By using these four types we have developed the structure for the digit-recognizer KNeighbourClassifier,RandomForestClassifier,GaussianNB,NeuralNetworks
 Above types more accuracy got for NeuralNetworks its:-91% accuracygot least was GaussianNB is:-55%
